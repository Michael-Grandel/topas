Dependencies:

- cmake (tested with version 2.2-patch3 and 2.4.1-beta)
  you can download cmake at http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html
- libxml2 >= 2.6.0
- blas
- gsl
- xmlblaster (http://xmlblaster.org) (you need at least the client-c-api)

You need cmake (http://www.cmake.org) for building the system. Install the
packet and start cmake:

$ cmake .

This should create all the necessary Makefiles for you. You'll need a working
xmlBlaster installation to compile the sources.

Then go and compile the packet:

$ make

Options for cmake:

- You can disable IDMEF support via:

$ cmake -DIDMEF=OFF .

- You can set the path to your xmlBlaster installation by unsing the
  XML_BLASTER_HOME variable:

$ cmake -DXML_BLASTER_HOME=/path/to/your/xmlBlaster/

If cmake fails (and you don't know why), please try the following steps:

1.) delete CMakeCache.txt and rerun cmake.
2.) If the problem still exists, please send cmake's output and the file
    CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log to <braunl@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de> and i'll
    have a look at it.


Have fun :)
