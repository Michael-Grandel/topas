                           A very light and simple
                           traffic printing module
                           =======================



To use this module, you have to:

1) enable it in the IPFIX collector's XML configuration file, through
   <module>
        <filename>path/to/print-module</filename>
	<arg>path/to/print-module-xml-configuration-file</arg>
   </module>

2) provide some configuration information in the module's XML
   configuration file; this information is detailled in section I of
   this README file

III - Known bugs



I - Configuration
=================

Only one thing has to be provided in the XML configuration file,
in section <preferences>: the path to the module output file,
in the field <output_file>. If not given, or if troubles opening
it occur (e.g. access-rights problems), the module will issue a
warning message and exit.



II - How does it work?
======================

This module is based on the third example module by Lothar Braun
(ipfix-collector/detectionmodules/examplemodules/third).

It works "in real time" by setting its alarm time to 0: as soon as
a new record is received from the collector, the data storage class
will store its IPFIX fields and be read by the main detection
class; the information in the storage class will then be written
to the output file:

- flow start
- flow end
- source IP
- destination IP
- protocol
- source port
- destination port
- number of packets in flow
- number of bytes in flow

The output is a table with header:

FlwStrt|FlwEnd|Source IP      |Dest IP        |Prot|SrcPort|DestPort|Pckts|Bytes
-------|------|---------------|---------------|----|-------|--------|-----|-----



III - Known bugs
================

When protocol is ICMP (protocol ID = 1), source and destination ports are 0.
It's not really a bug, just the initial values for all fields. As port
numbers are quite irrelevant for ICMP, it's also not a problem.
